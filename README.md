# EIT_FRFoM: An Imaged Based EIT Figure-of-Merit
The project provides a simple and reproducible methodology for the universal evaluation of the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems using reconstructed images.

## Background
EIT is an impedance measurement technique that uses the tomography principle to reconstruct an image that illustrates the inner impedance distribution of the subject under test (SUT), it's basic working principle is as shown below:

## Universal Figure-of-Merit (FoM) for EIT system evaluation
Based on objective full referencing (FR), this evaluation method provides a visually distinguishable hot colormap and quantitative image quality metrics. 

Using the FR metric, a imaged based EIT FoM is proposed:

__P<sub>system</sub>__ is the system power consumption

__*f*__ is the system EIT operating frequency

__Global FR__ is the quantitative image quality metric

__Frame Rate__ is the system image frame per second

The new FoM addresses the issues where common electrical parameters used in EIT hardware evaluation are not directly related to the quality of EIT images.
