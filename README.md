# EIT_FRFoM: An Imaged Based EIT Figure-of-Merit
The project provides a simple and reproducible methodology for the universal evaluation of the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems using reconstructed images.

## Background
EIT is an impedance measurement technique that uses the tomography principle to reconstruct an image that illustrates the inner impedance distribution of the subject under test (SUT), it's basic working principle is as shown below:
